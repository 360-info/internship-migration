## Introduction


---

# Introduction

## Background and Motivation

--

◾ Migration is the movement of an individual/a group of people from its usual place of residence to another place (within the country of residence or internationally) temporarily or permanently.

--

◾ Apart from legal migrants, illegal migrants often took high risk sea travel to move away from its country of residence.

--

◾ A considerable number of migrants are being trapped under modern slavery and being forced to provide primarily labour/sexual services for free.

# Introduction

  .panel[.panel-name[Aim]
--

### This visualisation project aims to raise the public awareness of illegal and trafficked migrants, in corporation with [360info](https://360info.org/) platform.

#### ◾ Visualisations produced will be focusing on the following aspects:


-	The missing and dead migrants overtime across regions
-	The route of trafficking, from which country most victims are located at, and to which country most victims are exploited?
-	Demographic features of victims and how it is related to type of exploits.

   ◾ Several methods of demonstrating the counts allocated to each victim group are attempted from version 1-5.
   
   ◾ Decided to use percentage at the later stage.
   
   ◾ After version 5 is created, an error is identified as the result of misusing `position = “dodge”` in `geom_col`, as percentage bar does not add up to 1 for each type of exploits.
   
   ◾ Version 6 is produced and avoids the previous errors.

### Data Limitation

◾ Specificity of the target group in data collection.

◾ Limits the completeness of data.

### Future Analysis

◾ Expecting more incidents and cases can be found and recorded by increasing speed of information dissemination nowadays.
